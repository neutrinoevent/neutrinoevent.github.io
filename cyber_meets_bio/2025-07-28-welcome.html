    <h2 id="overview">📡 Overview</h2>
    <p>This is the first in a set of loosely structured, lab-style entries documenting research, observation, and theoretical synthesis around how **electromagnetic fields affect biological systems** — particularly at the cellular and subcellular level.</p>
    <p>Key interest areas include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resonant frequency ranges for cell membranes</li>
      <li>Voltage-gated ion channels as field-sensitive mechanisms</li>
      <li>Low-frequency EM fields & calcium efflux modulation</li>
      <li>Phase coherence across tissue structures</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2 id="mechanics">⚙️ Bioelectric Basics</h2>
    <p>All cells maintain a resting membrane potential. Neurons and muscle cells modulate this actively, but *all* membranes rely on ionic gradients and structural polarization:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Typical neuron: ~ -70mV resting potential
Membrane capacitance: ~1 µF/cm²
</code></pre>
    <p>This makes biological tissue both conductive *and* reactive to external EM influences — not unlike tuned circuits.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2 id="field-effects">📐 Known EM Field Effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Weak pulsed fields (Hz–kHz) have been shown to modulate calcium ion release</li>
      <li>Static magnetic fields influence proton alignment (see: MRI principles)</li>
      <li>Millimeter wave exposure linked to altered gene expression (with debate)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One emerging idea is that cells may **naturally oscillate** at characteristic frequencies depending on their type and state — which opens the door to resonance-based tuning or interference.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2 id="parallel">🔍 Analogies from Electronics</h2>
    <p>If you treat cells as RLC circuits (resistor–inductor–capacitor), resonance theory gives a framework for potential interaction. Each cellular structure could act like a **micro-antenna** tuned to specific frequencies based on its size, ionic composition, and membrane properties.</p>

<pre><code class="language-none">Resonant frequency (simplified): f = 1 / (2π√(LC))
Where:
  L = inductance (circulating ion current loops?)
  C = capacitance of membrane
</code></pre>

    <p>Whether this holds in living systems is still under debate — but it's a useful model.</p>
