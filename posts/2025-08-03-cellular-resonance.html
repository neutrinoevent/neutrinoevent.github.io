    <h2 id="why">🧠 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>If cells possess signature resonances — subtle frequency “IDs” tied to their function or state — then biological behavior is partially field-mediated. Structure emerges not just from DNA or chemistry, but from resonance dynamics in local and global morphic fields.</p>
    <p>This matters because it reframes biology: less as a hardcoded machine, more as a **dynamically tuned oscillator** system where coherence equals function.</p>

    <h2 id="core">📡 The Core Idea</h2>
    <p>Each cell type (neuron, myocyte, hepatocyte, etc.) may maintain **a specific set of resonant frequencies** tied to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Membrane composition and charge distribution</li>
      <li>Organelle structure (esp. mitochondrial and Golgi lattices)</li>
      <li>Intracellular ion patterns (Ca²⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻ flow)</li>
      <li>Geometry and cytoskeletal tension (tensegrity frameworks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These factors combine into something like a “resonance fingerprint” — modifiable under stress, signal, or entrainment.</p>

    <h2 id="morphic">🌀 Morphic Field Coupling</h2>
    <p>Sheldrake’s morphic field hypothesis — controversial but intriguing — suggests that living systems inherit a non-material template of form and behavior. In this model, **resonance is the coupling layer** that syncs biology to these fields.</p>

<pre><code class="language-none">
DNA:   local hardware config
EM:    communication + control
Morphic:  pattern memory across time
</code></pre>

    <p>Maybe memory isn't just intracellular. Maybe it's field-carried — a kind of non-local “template recall” that guides regrowth, differentiation, or even cognition.</p>

    <h2 id="experiments">🧪 Observables and Experiments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure EM emissions from isolated single-cell organisms during stress or division</li>
      <li>Use pulsed EM fields to induce or inhibit differentiation pathways</li>
      <li>Compare recovery speed in tissue samples exposed to scalar vs incoherent fields</li>
      <li>Track phase coherence between cardiac tissue and brainwave rhythms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key metric: coherence and re-synchronization rate post-disruption.</p>

    <h2 id="stacking">🔗 Layered Resonance Systems</h2>
    <p>Think of tissues as **nested resonant systems**:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cell → local oscillation (ion transport, cytoskeletal dynamics)</li>
      <li>Tissue → group coherence (field harmonics)</li>
      <li>Organ → tuned aggregate (phase-locked entrainment)</li>
      <li>Body → global biofield (nested feedback control)</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      Tuning one layer affects all above and below it. Just like an RLC ladder or stacked oscillator chain.

    <h2 id="analogies">🎛️ Analogies from Audio & Radio</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Neurons ≈ frequency-modulated burst oscillators</li>
      <li>Cardiac sync = standing wave + pacemaker node</li>
      <li>Acupuncture meridians ≈ conductive pathways for phase-coupled field flows</li>
      <li>Mitochondria = microcapacitor & energy rhythm converter</li>
    </ul>

"Illness" = decoherence
"Healing" = re-synchronization
