    <h1>ðŸ‘¤ About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Alexander Nichols â€” currently studying physics at Old Dominion University, with a growing interest in how physical systems express structure, energy, and intelligence. This site is part lab journal, part digital sketchpad â€” a place to track ideas across physics, electromagnetism, biological coherence, and symbolic models of the natural world.
    </p>

    <p>
      My background has also included systems programming and ethical hacking, but Iâ€™m currently exploring deeper into resonance physics, quantum frameworks, and the idea that matter, energy, and form may encode information far beyond traditional models.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Fall 2025, Iâ€™m enrolled in the following courses â€” forming the backbone of my next phase of study:

    <h2>ðŸŽ“ Fall 2025 Coursework @ ODU</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>PHYS 137T â€“ Intro to Quantum Science & Technology:</strong><br>
        A conceptual and quantitative intro to superposition, interference, and entanglement, with applications in quantum computing, sensing, and communications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PHYS 323 â€“ Modern Physics:</strong><br>
        Covers wave-particle duality, nuclear/atomic structure, and special relativity with applications in materials and electrodynamics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PHYS 355 â€“ Mathematical Methods of Physics:</strong><br>
        Linear algebra, vector calculus, differential equations, and complex analysis â€” tools for advanced physical modeling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PHYS 303 â€“ Intermediate Experimental Physics:</strong><br>
        Hands-on lab course covering instrumentation, op-amps, signal circuits, and microcontroller interfacing with LabVIEW and Arduino.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MATH 312 â€“ Calculus III:</strong><br>
        Multivariable calculus, vector functions, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and intro to vector fields and Greenâ€™s/Stokesâ€™ Theorems.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These arenâ€™t just boxes to check â€” theyâ€™re scaffolding for a deeper exploration of emergent systems, resonance theory, and field-based interpretations of matter and cognition. If you're working in these spaces â€” physics, biophysics, consciousness models, experimental EM â€” let's connect!
